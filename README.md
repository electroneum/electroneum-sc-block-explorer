The Electroneum Smartchain Explorer provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on the Electroneum Smartchain, the respective testnet, or any private versions of the Electroneum network that you might create for your own testing purposes.

Please see the parent project (Blockscout) [documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions, and for related questions, comments and feature requests see the [discussions section](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/discussions).

## About BlockScout

BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Electroneum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable.  As Electroneum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.
