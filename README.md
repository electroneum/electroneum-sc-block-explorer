The Electroneum Smartchain Explorer provides a comprehensive, easy-to-use interface for users to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on the Electroneum Smartchain, the respective testnet, or any private versions of the Electroneum network that you might create for your own testing purposes.

Please see the parent project (Blockscout) [documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for detailed information and setup instructions, and for related questions, comments and feature requests see the [discussions section](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/discussions).

## About Blockscout

Blockscout allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, verify and interact with smart contracts and view and interact with applications on the Electroneum network including many forks, sidechains, L2s and testnets.

Blockscout is an open-source alternative to centralized, closed source block explorers such as Etherscan, Etherchain and others.  As Electroneum sidechains and L2s continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate all transactions.

## Supported Projects

Blockscout currently supports several hundred chains and rollups throughout the greater blockchain ecosystem. Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Avalanche, Near and many others include Blockscout integrations. [A comprehensive list is available here](https://docs.blockscout.com/about/projects). If your project is not listed, please submit a PR or [contact the team in Discord](https://discord.com/invite/blockscout).
